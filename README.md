- Genesis block is determined by Ethereum hard fork block hash / timestamp. Network id 42.
    - Testnet uses proposed soft fork parameters, network id 43
- Quick and dirty distribution with exponentially decaying block rewards has two goals:

    - It emulates a proof of burn from the ETH miners and holders directly after the hard fork block.
    - It should quickly reach an equilibrium state where transaction fees pay for POW to the extent that apps collectively can and want to subsidize the chain's security.

- The base token, "FEE", is to be framed as a claim on finite future network resources (especially cpu-hours). The supply converges to 1 FEE.
- `bootstrap.txt` is insignficant when not "instantiated" in a chain. "It" can be "modified"; the bootstrap document actually encoded in Perma cannot.
